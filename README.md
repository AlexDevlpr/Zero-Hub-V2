# Zero Hub V2
A really good roblox scripthub that focuses on providing the best cheating experience to it's users. 

# USAGE: 
Just go to ZeroHub v2.lua and copy the script inside of it (Launcher), then paste it in your executor and execute it. Make sure your game is supported (Supported Games.txt)

(OR)

You can go to the games folder to execute certain scripts, by yourself. Else if you're a developer, You can use it to learn and see how it works.

NOTE: ZeroHub v2 is being constantly developed by me, Expect a update on this repo **ANYTIME**. So, this is not the final version of this repo.
